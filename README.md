### Dynamic website built with Etsy's open REST API data
> visit https://www.etsy.com/developers/ for more information

Goal of this project was to practice frontend development as much as possible.
In this project you can discover over **60 million products** that are dinamically 
changed by users online. "Widicy" allows you to search all of them, discover their
pricing, description, images and the option to add it to your cart where the total sum of items is added.

Project was lots of fun to build in React. 
NPM packages and React hooks simplified the built process. 
Some of the technologies you can find in this project are: 
* HTML 
  - JSX
  
*CSS
  - Styled Components
  - media queries 
  
 *JavaScript
    -React
  
  React:
   - useState
   - useEffect
   - useContext
   - Route, Switch
   - Link
   - useHistor
   - localStorage
   - Framer Motion
    
Some of the challenges I faced: price sorting in search page, cart pricing while lifting state up in React components,
conditional rending until data is resolved...

Big appreciation to "web dev web design" Discord community that is always happy to help.
